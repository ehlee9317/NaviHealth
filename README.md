# NAVIHEALTH
NAVIHEALTH is an iOS based  app designed to help you track and meet your fitness goals while on the go. Along with a navigational map functionality, NAVIHEALTH stores the calories you can burn when you're trying to get from point A to point B and renders them onto beautiful charts to display daily, weekly, monthly progress.

# TECH STACK
NAVIHEALTH was written with React Native and powered by Expo-cli. NAVIHEALTH leverages Apple Maps, Google Places and Google Directions APIs to set up convenient routes for walking, biking and public transit. For data visualization NAVIHEALTH utilizes Victory to render out clean charts for users to keep track of calorie data across their routes. All data for users and user authentication, maps and routing, and user calorie management / tracking is managed through Google Firebase.
